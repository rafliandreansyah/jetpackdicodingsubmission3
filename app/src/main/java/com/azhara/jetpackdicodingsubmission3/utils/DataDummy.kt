Rebelde was replaced in June 2006 with Televisa's new series Código Postal.\\n\\nThe series is set at the Elite Way School, a prestigious private boarding high school in Mexico City with a major plot line revolving around a group of students forming a pop band. Additional subplots involve the school's faculty and the students' parents. One trademark of the show is the random use of English words and phrases, often used by fresa characters.\\n\\nA notable aspect of the series is that the actors playing the bandmembers are themselves in an actual band named RBD, and perform most of the music used on the show. They have been extremely successful in their own right, becoming one of the most popular acts in Latin America and touring internationally.\\n\\nRebelde began airing March 21, 2005 and ended on December 15, 2006. The show was also transmitted in 65 other countries, including Serbia, Peru, Romania on Acasa TV, Brazil, Spain on Antena 3, Slovenia, Bulgaria and from September 2009 in Slovakia on TV Doma, in Croatia on Nova TV and in Albania on Vizion Plus.",
